# This is the same problem as "Distance Oracle I" except that instead of
# only having to deal with binary trees, the assignment asks you to
# create labels for all tree graphs.
#
# In the shortest-path oracle described in Andrew Goldberg's
# interview, each node has a label, which is a list of some other
# nodes in the network and their distance to these nodes.  These lists
# have the property that
#
#  (1) for any pair of nodes (x,y) in the network, their lists will
#  have at least one node z in common
#
#  (2) the shortest path from x to y will go through z.
#
# Given a graph G that is a tree, preprocess the graph to
# create such labels for each node.  Note that the size of the list in
# each label should not be larger than log n for a graph of size n.
#

#
# create_labels takes in a tree and returns a dictionary, mapping each
# node to its label
#
# a label is a dictionary mapping another node and the distance to
# that node
